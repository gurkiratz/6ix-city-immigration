                  <p>
                    Express Entry is an online immigration application system
                    introduced by the Government of Canada to manage
                    applications for permanent residence. It covers three main
                    economic immigration programs:

                  <ul className="content-list list-unstyled">
                    <li>Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP)</li>

                    <li>Canadian Experience Class (CEC)</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    Express Entry is designed to select skilled workers who are
                    most likely to succeed in Canadaâ€™s labor market.

                    <li>
                      Candidates create an online profile where they provide
                      information about their skills, work experience, language
                      ability, education, and other personal details.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Profiles are ranked using the Comprehensive Ranking System
                      (CRS), which assigns points based on the provided
                      information.
