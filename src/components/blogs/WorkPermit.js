                  <p>
                    A <b>Work Permit</b> is a document issued by Immigration,
                    Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) that allows foreign
                    nationals to work in Canada for a specified period. There
                    are two main types of work permits:{' '}

                  <p>
                    An employer-specific work permit allows you to work for a
                    specific employer in a specific location for a specified
                    duration. It typically requires a Labour Market Impact
                    Assessment (LMIA) from the employer.

                  <h3 className="h4">Open Work Permit</h3>
                  <p>
                    An open work permit allows you to work for any employer in
                    Canada (with some exceptions). This type of permit does not
                    require an LMIA and is often issued to spouses of skilled
                    workers or international students, or to participants in
                    certain programs.

                      Determine Eligibility: Ensure you meet the eligibility
                      criteria, including proof of job offer (if applicable),
                      sufficient funds, and a clean criminal record.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Obtain LMIA (if required): For employer-specific permits,
                      the employer must apply for and receive a positive LMIA.

                    <li>
                      Gather Documentation: Collect all necessary documents,
                      such as the job offer, LMIA (if applicable), passport,
                      proof of funds, and any additional documents specified by
                      IRCC.

                    <li>
                      Processing and Decision: Wait for the application to be
                      processed and receive the decision. If approved, you will
                      receive a port of entry letter of introduction and, if
